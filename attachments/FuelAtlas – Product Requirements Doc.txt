FuelAtlas – Product Requirements Document (PRD)
SECTION 1: PROJECT IDENTIFICATION
PROJECT: Fuel Atlas
VERSION: 1.0.0
LAST UPDATED: 2026-02-11

SECTION 2: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

FuelAtlas is a global fuel price intelligence and navigation SaaS platform that helps drivers locate the best nearby fuel stations using near real-time pricing data, route optimization, and intelligent alerts. The application integrates mapping technology with localized fuel price data sources to help users reduce fuel expenses and make smarter refueling decisions.

FuelAtlas targets commuters, daily drivers, long-distance travelers, and commercial drivers who want reliable fuel price comparisons and route-based refueling optimization. By combining geolocation, station pricing analytics, predictive alerts, and multilingual accessibility, FuelAtlas positions itself as a globally scalable, user-friendly, and data-driven driving assistant.

Existing competitors often operate regionally or rely heavily on crowdsourced pricing. FuelAtlas aims to differentiate through standardized global fuel data normalization, predictive pricing insights, multi-country support, and intelligent route cost optimization, creating both consumer and enterprise monetization opportunities.
